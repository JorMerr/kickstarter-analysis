# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

	The purpose of this project is to assist Louise in determining the success of previous Kickstarter campaigns in a similar category. The goal of this analysis is to give Louise a metric on which to base her Kickstarter campaigns success and give her more information of what she may be able to expect as her campaign continues.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

	Analysis shows in chart "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" that Kickstarter campaigns within the category of Theater have seen the most success when launched in the month of May. Our data indicates this trend is an average success rate of Kickstarter campaigns launched between 2009 and 2017. 
	Our data also indicates that the margin between successful and failed Theater Kickstarter campaigns is narrower between the months of September and January, and wider between the months of February and August. Further analysis may be warranted to determine the cause of this trend. The analysis of the data at this time does not speculate on the cause.
	While the average highest rate of successfully funded Theater Kickstarter campaigns are launched in the month of May, our data indicates that the absolute values of failed Kickstarter campaigns in the same category are highest in the months of May (52), July (50), and October (50). Our data indicates that while these months have the highest rate of failure, our assumption is that this may be in part due to the relatively high total of Kickstarter campaigns launched in those months for the same category.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

	Analysis of Kickstarter outcomes in the Plays subcategory gased on the funding goal of campaigns shows an overall trend of negative correlation. As the initial funding goal of the campaign increases, our data shows a decrease in the probability of success. 
	The trend shows inconsistency with this correlation when goal amounts are within the range of $35,000 to $44,999. This may require further analysis, however one initial assumption is that our sample size for data in the range is limited to a total of 9 campaigns, and so any singular data point may skew results of trends.
	This anaylsis does not take into account any additional factors such as, but not limited to: notoriety of the individual or company organizing the campaig; intended production level; location of campaign; or campaign stretch goals.
	

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

	In completing analysis, there was some difficulty in determining validity of findings due to the limited sample size of the Subcategory "Plays" within Kickstarter. The total sample size of the specific Subcategory was 1,047, while the total data sample included 4113 projects. This relatively limited sample size means that individual data points have a larger impact on overall trends. By obtaining additional data from either more recent years of Kickstarter campaigns, or from additional crowdfunding platforms, we may be able to better refine our analysis.
	An additional challenge presents itself when we consider that the data we have gathered only allows us to analyze the success of the Kickstarter campaigns until the end of the campaign period. This means that our assumption of success does not extend to the completion of the project and fulfillment of all listed campaign rewards. It is possible that some of the successful Kickstarter campaigns were not able to complete their stated project after the campaign closed and deliver to Kickstarter backers what they had planned. Our data allows for a narrow definition of success, and the definition is specific to whether the Kickstarter campaign creator received the funding needed according to the goal, and not whether the backers recevied the benefits they anticipated.
	

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

	This first conclusion we can draw regarding Kickstarter outcomes based on the campaign Launch Date is that campaigns launched in the months of May and June have been most succesful for funding of theater related projects. 
	The second conclusion we can draw is that the months of May, June, July, August, and October all have the highest rate of failed theater related Kickstarter campaigns. This may be due in part to the higher total number of Kickstarter campaigns of the category Theater launched during those months. Futher analysis to that effect may be warranted.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

	My analysis concludes that Kickstarter campaing outcomes for the subcategory Plays have had the most consitent percentage of successful funding when the Goal has been set at less than $15,000. Given the data available, I note success for Kickstarter campaigns for Plays with goals set from $35,000 to less than $45,000, however with the limited source data within that range of less than 10 total plays, I cannot be certain that this trends would be consistent for further Kickstarter campaigns.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

	One limitation of the dataset used in this analysis is that we have a limited sample size for Kickstarter campaigns with the goal of funding Plays especially with campaign goals set above $10,000. 
	A further limitation is that the information has only been collected from one crowdfunding platform, Kickstarer, and we have not included any data from other such platforms. 
	It must be noted that the dataset used includes information collected between the years of 2009-2017. This excludes any campaigns which may be relevant to our analysis in more recent years. There may be benefit in collection more recent data in order to determine if any trends have shifted since 2017.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

	Other tables or graphs we may be able to create from our dataset include: 
- percentage of funding reached for successful/failed/canceled campaigns. 
	- this would allow us to analyze for degree of success or failure.

- whether any failed or cancelled Kickstarter campaigns were launched again.
	- this would allow us to refine our dataset further, and analyze whether failed or cancelled campaigns were successful or not after launching again.
	
- compare success of the Plays category with another Subcategory of the Theater Parent category.
	- this analysis may help determine whether Louise's production of *Fever* may be successfully developed into other media types.
